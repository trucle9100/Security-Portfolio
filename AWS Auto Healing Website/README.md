## **üîß Key Technical Implementation**

### 1. EC2 Instance Configuration
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Web Server Installation Script
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y httpd stress
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Health Check Page</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
```

### 2. CloudWatch Alarm Setup
```bash
# Create CPU utilization alarm
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
    --alarm-name "High-CPU-Usage" \
    --alarm-description "Alarm when CPU exceeds 80%" \
    --metric-name CPUUtilization \
    --namespace AWS/EC2 \
    --statistic Average \
    --period 300 \
    --threshold 80 \
    --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
    --evaluation-periods 1
```

### 3. Stress Testing for Validation
```bash
# SSH into instance and simulate high CPU load
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
sudo yum install stress -y
stress --cpu 2 --timeout 300  # Simulate 100% CPU for 5 mins
```

## **üìã Lab Environment Disclaimer**

This project represents a hands-on AWS infrastructure automation laboratory exercise designed to demonstrate self-healing architecture implementation techniques. Key clarifications:

- **Metrics**: The "before" and "after" business impact metrics represent potential improvements based on industry best practices and common infrastructure challenges
- **Environment**: Single-account AWS learning environment with t2.micro EC2 instance, demonstrating patterns applicable to enterprise-scale deployments
- **Scope**: CloudWatch monitoring with SNS alerting implementation, showcasing techniques used in production auto-healing systems
- **Business Impact**: Uptime improvements and efficiency gains represent demonstrated capabilities of the implemented monitoring and alerting patterns
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Current implementation focuses on monitoring and alerting; full auto-recovery requires additional AWS services like Auto Scaling Groups

The technical implementation follows AWS Well-Architected principles and demonstrates real-world infrastructure automation patterns suitable for production environments.
