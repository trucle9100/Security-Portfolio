## Lessons Learned üü° (FORMAT PURPOSES ONLY)

**Automation Reduces Human Error**: Manual security fixes are slow and error-prone. Automated Lambda remediation ensures consistent, fast responses to security violations.

**Testing is Critical**: Always test automation by intentionally breaking things. This lab taught me to validate that detection and remediation actually work before deploying to production.

**AWS Services Integration**: Learned how AWS Config, EventBridge, and Lambda work together to create a complete compliance monitoring and remediation pipeline.
