## Lessons Learned

**Infrastructure as Code Benefits**: Manual console configuration is error-prone and not repeatable. This lab reinforced the importance of scripting all infrastructure changes for consistency and version control.

**Monitoring Granularity Matters**: Initial 1-minute periods created too much noise. Learning to balance between quick detection and false positive reduction was crucial for operational efficiency.

**Testing Under Load**: Stress testing revealed that theoretical configurations don't always match real-world behavior. Always validate monitoring thresholds under actual load conditions.

**Documentation is Critical**: Creating runbooks during implementation, not after, ensures accurate troubleshooting procedures and knowledge transfer for L1/L2/L3 support teams.
