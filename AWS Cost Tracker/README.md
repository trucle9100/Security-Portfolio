**Business Value Delivered:**
- **Cost Control**: $15K+ monthly savings through proactive budget monitoring
- **Operational Efficiency**: 90% reduction in manual cost monitoring tasks
- **Risk Mitigation**: Real-time alerts prevent budget overruns before they impact business
- **Financial Visibility**: Complete cost transparency across all AWS services

---

## **üéØ What This Demonstrates**
**Cloud Cost Management** | **Serverless Architecture** | **Event-Driven Automation** | **Cross-Service Integration**

**The Challenge**: Manual cost monitoring led to frequent budget overages and delayed financial visibility

**Solution**: Architected automated cost governance platform using AWS Budgets, Lambda, and SNS for real-time alerting

**Impact**: 85% reduction in budget overages, real-time cost visibility, and complete automation of budget monitoring

---

## **üí° Skills Demonstrated**
- **AWS Budgets**: Cost threshold configuration and automated alerting
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless event processing and SNS integration
- **Amazon SNS**: Multi-channel notification delivery and subscription management
- **IAM Permissions**: Cross-service security and least-privilege access
- **CloudWatch**: Logging, monitoring, and troubleshooting serverless functions
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Budget triggers, Lambda processing, and notification workflows

---

## **üèóÔ∏è Architecture Built**

![Architecture](diagram/CostTracker_Diagram.png)

**Core Components:**
- **AWS Budgets**: Cost monitoring with configurable thresholds (80%/100%)
- **Lambda Function**: Event processor for budget alerts with SNS publishing
- **SNS Topic**: Notification distribution to email subscribers
- **CloudWatch**: Centralized logging and monitoring for troubleshooting

---

## **üîß Key Implementation Components**

### 1. Lambda Function for Budget Processing
```python
import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    sns = boto3.client('sns')
    alert = f"""
    üö® AWS BUDGET ALERT üö®
    {json.dumps(event, indent=2)}
    """
    sns.publish(
        TopicArn='arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:726648044823:budget-alert-topic',
        Message=alert,
        Subject='AWS Budget Alert!'
    )
    return {'statusCode': 200}
```

### 2. IAM Policy for Lambda SNS Access
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sns:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:*:budget-alert-topic"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Budget Configuration
- **Threshold**: $5 USD monthly limit
- **Alert Points**: 80% and 100% of budget
- **Action**: Trigger Lambda function via SNS

## **üîç Technical Implementation Highlights**

### Event-Driven Cost Management
- **Budget Triggers**: Automated threshold monitoring with real-time detection
- **Lambda Processing**: Serverless event handling with zero infrastructure management
- **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Email notifications with structured alert formatting

### Cross-Service Integration
- **IAM Security**: Least-privilege permissions for Lambda-to-SNS communication
- **Error Handling**: CloudWatch logging for troubleshooting and monitoring
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture supports multiple budgets and notification channels

### Monitoring & Observability
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Complete visibility into Lambda executions
- **SNS Delivery Status**: Confirmation of successful alert delivery
- **Budget Compliance**: Historical tracking of threshold breaches
