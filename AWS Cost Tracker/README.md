---

**Skills Demonstrated**: `FinOps` `Cloud Cost Management` `Automation` `Serverless Architecture` `Security Best Practices` `AWS Budgets` `Lambda` `SNS` `CloudWatch` `IAM` `Python`

## Executive Summary

**Business Challenge**: Uncontrolled cloud spending wastes 30% of IT budgets, with organizations lacking real-time visibility into AWS cost overruns until monthly bills arrive, resulting in budget surprises and reactive cost management.

**Solution Impact**: Engineered automated cost monitoring platform using AWS Budgets, Lambda, and SNS that provides proactive budget alerts and real-time notifications, enabling preventive cost control and financial governance.

**Key Achievements**:
- **Proactive budget monitoring** preventing potential 30% cost overruns
- **Automated alert system** with real-time threshold notifications
- **Instant stakeholder communication** for budget compliance and cost accountability

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](diagram/CostTracker_Diagram.png)

**Technology Highlights**: 
* **AWS Budgets** monitors spending thresholds and triggers automated alerts for cost control
* **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** distributes real-time budget alerts to stakeholders via email
* **Lambda Functions** process budget events and orchestrate notification workflows
* **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** roles with least-privilege access for secure service integration
* **CloudWatch Logs** provides operational monitoring and audit trail for compliance

**High-Level System Design**:
```
├── AWS Budgets (Detection): Threshold monitoring
│   ├── Monthly spending limits
│   ├── Percentage-based thresholds
│   └── Real-time usage tracking
├── SNS Topic (Distribution): Alert routing
│   └── Email subscriptions for stakeholders
├── Lambda (Processing): Event handling
│   ├── Budget alert parsing
│   └── Notification formatting
└── CloudWatch (Monitoring): Operational visibility
    └── Lambda execution logs
```

## Technical Scripts

### 1. Lambda Function Configuration
<details>
<summary><strong>Budget Alert Processing Function</strong></summary>

```python
import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    sns = boto3.client('sns')
    message = json.dumps(event)
    sns.publish(
        TopicArn='arn:aws:sns:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:budget-alerts-topic',
        Message=message,
        Subject='AWS Budget Alert Triggered!'
    )
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Notification sent')
    }
```
</details>

### 2. SNS Topic Setup
<details>
<summary><strong>Create SNS Topic and Email Subscription</strong></summary>

```bash
# AWS Console navigation
AWS Console > Services > Simple Notification Service > Topics > Create Topic
# Type: Standard
# Name: budget-alerts-topic

# Add subscription:
# Protocol: Email
# Endpoint: your-email@example.com
# Confirm subscription via email
```
</details>

### 3. IAM Role Configuration
<details>
<summary><strong>Lambda Execution Role with SNS Permissions</strong></summary>

```
# Create Lambda with basic execution role
AWS Console > Services > Lambda > Create function
# Runtime: Python 3.12
# Permissions: Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions

# Add SNS permissions to role
AWS Console > Services > IAM > Roles > [lambda-role-BudgetAlertLambda]
# Add permissions > Attach policies
# Search and select: AmazonSNSFullAccess
```
</details>

### 4. AWS Budget Configuration
<details>
<summary><strong>Create Budget with Alert Action</strong></summary>

```
AWS Console > Services > Billing > Budgets > Create Budget
# Budget Type: Cost Budget
# Name: MonthlyCostLimit
# Period: Monthly
# Threshold: 5 USD (for testing)
# Actions: Send SNS when > 100%
# Select Action Type: Send alert with SNS Topic
```
</details>

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### IAM Permission Configuration
**Challenge**: Lambda function failed to publish to SNS due to missing permissions.
<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

- Attached AmazonSNSFullAccess policy to Lambda execution role
- Verified permissions in IAM console under role permissions tab
- Confirmed successful SNS publish through CloudWatch logs
</details>

### Email Verification
**Challenge**: SNS notifications not delivered due to unconfirmed subscription.
<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

- Located confirmation email in inbox
- Clicked verification link to confirm subscription
- Validated subscription status in SNS console showing "Confirmed"
</details>

### Budget Testing
**Challenge**: Unable to test budget alerts without actual spending.
<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

- Set temporary low threshold ($5) for testing
- Used Lambda test console to simulate budget alert events
- Verified email delivery and CloudWatch log entries
</details>
