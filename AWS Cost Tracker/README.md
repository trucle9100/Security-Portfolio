## Architecture Built

![Architecture](diagram/CostTracker_Diagram.png)

**Core Components:**
- **AWS Budgets**: Cost monitoring with configurable thresholds (80%/100%)
- **Lambda Function**: Event processor for budget alerts with SNS publishing
- **SNS Topic**: Notification distribution to email subscribers
- **CloudWatch**: Centralized logging and monitoring for troubleshooting

## Key Implementation Components

### 1. Lambda Function for Budget Processing
```python
import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    sns = boto3.client('sns')
    alert = f"""
    ðŸš¨ AWS BUDGET ALERT ðŸš¨
    {json.dumps(event, indent=2)}
    """
    sns.publish(
        TopicArn='arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:726648044823:budget-alert-topic',
        Message=alert,
        Subject='AWS Budget Alert!'
    )
    return {'statusCode': 200}
```

### 2. IAM Policy for Lambda SNS Access
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sns:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:*:budget-alert-topic"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Budget Configuration
- **Threshold**: $5 USD monthly limit
- **Alert Points**: 80% and 100% of budget
- **Action**: Trigger Lambda function via SNS

### Important Notes
- All metrics represent estimates based on lab environment analysis and industry benchmarks
- Actual results may vary depending on cloud usage patterns, organizational size, and existing cost management practices
- Cost calculations use conservative estimates and may not reflect all potential savings
- Industry benchmarks are approximations derived from multiple sources and should be used for reference only
- Lab environment simulates real-world cost scenarios but may not capture all production variables
- Savings calculations assume consistent usage patterns and may fluctuate based on business requirements
