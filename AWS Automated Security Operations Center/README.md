## **üîß Key Security Automations Implemented**

### 1. Automated Security Group Remediation
```python
def remediate_security_group(sg_id):
    """Remove overly permissive rules automatically"""
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    # Remove 0.0.0.0/0 access rules
    for rule in security_group_rules:
        if rule['CidrIp'] == '0.0.0.0/0':
            ec2.revoke_security_group_ingress(
                GroupId=sg_id, 
                IpPermissions=[rule]
            )
```

### 2. S3 Bucket Hardening
```python
def remediate_s3_bucket(bucket_name):
    """Enable encryption and block public access"""
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    # Enable default encryption
    s3.put_bucket_encryption(Bucket=bucket_name, ...)
    # Block all public access
    s3.put_public_access_block(Bucket=bucket_name, ...)
```

### 3. EventBridge Automation Rules
```json
{
  "source": ["aws.config"],
  "detail-type": ["Config Rules Compliance Change"],
  "detail": {
    "newEvaluationResult": {
      "complianceType": ["NON_COMPLIANT"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Testing Security Automation
```bash
# Created violations that were automatically remediated:
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket test-bucket --acl public-read
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-xxx --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
# Both automatically remediated through EventBridge ‚Üí Lambda flow
```

### Baseline Metrics Sources

<a name="ref1"></a>**[1] Configuration Drift Detection (3+ days industry average):**
- **Industry Context**: In 2024, it took three days on average for the occurrence to discovery of cyber incidents in US companies
- **Lab Context**: Simulated typical enterprise configuration monitoring without automation
- **Methodology**: Created intentional security misconfigurations (open security groups, public S3 buckets) to measure detection time
- **Scope Clarification**: This metric specifically addresses configuration compliance violations, not comprehensive security incident response
- **Cloud Advantage**: AWS automation capabilities enable far greater incident response automation than on-premises environments

<a name="ref2"></a>**[2] Security Rule Compliance (Manual Audits):**
- **Lab Context**: Pre-automation state with no Config rules deployed
- **Industry Pattern**: Traditional manual security audits conducted quarterly or monthly
- **Implementation**: Lab started with zero automated compliance monitoring - all security checks performed manually
- **Measurement**: Time required to manually audit 3 core security configurations across test resources
- **Automation Benefit**: Continuous monitoring vs. periodic manual reviews

<a name="ref3"></a>**[3] Config Violations (Undetected):**
- **Lab Context**: Security violations created intentionally without detection mechanisms
- **Industry Challenge**: Configuration drift often goes unnoticed until security incidents occur
- **Methodology**: Deployed resources with security misconfigurations (0.0.0.0/0 access, unencrypted buckets)
- **Baseline Period**: 24-hour observation period where violations existed without automated detection
- **Documentation**: CloudTrail logs show resource creation events with no corresponding remediation actions

<a name="ref4"></a>**[4] Security Operations (Manual Tasks - 95% Reduction):**
- **Calculation Method**:
  - **Manual Process**: 2 hours/week for security configuration audits
  - **Automated Process**: 6 minutes/week for dashboard review and exception handling
  - **Time Savings**: (120 - 6) / 120 = 95% reduction in manual effort
- **Tasks Automated**: Security group auditing, S3 bucket policy review, compliance checking, configuration remediation
- **Labor Cost Impact**: Security analyst @ $65/hour √ó 2 hours/week √ó 52 weeks = $6,760 annual savings per analyst
