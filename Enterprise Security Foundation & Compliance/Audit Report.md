# GlobalTech Enterprises - Security Foundation Audit Report  
---

## Executive Summary  
- The Challenge: GlobalTech had 8 critical security gaps across their AWS accounts with only 42% compliance score.
- What Was Built: Enterprise security foundation with automated monitoring that achieved 89% compliance in 4 hours.
- Business Impact: Reduced audit prep from 3 weeks to 2 days, eliminated all critical findings.

### Key Results  
| What We Fixed | Before | After |  
|--------|----------------|-----------------|  
| Security Score | 42% | 89% |  
| Critical Issues | 8 | 0 |  
| Time to Fix Problems | 3 days | 15 minutes |  

## Security Problems Solved
1. Public S3 Buckets (Most Common AWS Mistake)
    - The Problem: Company data was publicly accessible on the internet
      - S3 bucket had `public-read` permissions
      - Anyone could download sensitive files
    - The Fix:
  ```bash
  # Blocked all public access
  aws s3api put-public-access-block --bucket BUCKET_NAME \
    --public-access-block-configuration \
    "BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true"
```
   
        
2. EC2 Metadata Attacks (Advanced Security Issue)
    - The Problem: Servers were vulnerable to credential theft via SSRF attacks
      - EC2 instances using old metadata service (IMDSv1)
      - Attackers could steal AWS credentials remotely
    - The Fix:
  ```bash
# Required secure tokens for metadata access
aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options \
  --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID \
  --http-tokens required
```

3. Unencrypted Storage (Data Protection Basics)
    - The Problem: All new disk volumes were created without encryption
      - Sensitive data stored in plain text
      - Failed compliance requirements
    - The Fix:
  ```bash
# Made encryption the default for all new volumes
aws ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default
```

4. Weak Cross-Account Access (Multi-Account Security)
    - The Problem: Other AWS accounts could access resources too easily
      - No external ID requirement
      - Risk of "confused deputy" attacks
    - The Fix:
  ```bash
{
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "sts:ExternalId": "unique-external-id-123"
    }
  }
}
```

5. Developer Privilege Escalation (Advanced IAM)
    - The Problem: Developers could potentially gain admin access
      - No permission boundaries
      - Risk of insider threats
    - The Fix:
  ```bash
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": ["iam:*", "organizations:*", "account:*"],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

## The Monitoring System
- Real-Time Security Dashboard
  - AWS Security Hub: Centralized view of all security findings
  - AWS Config: Continuous compliance checking (not just daily scans)
  - CloudWatch: Executive dashboard showing security trends
- Automated Alerting
  - What Triggers Alerts: Non-compliant resources detected
  - How Fast: 8-minute detection time
  - Where Alerts Go: SNS â†’ Slack/Email
