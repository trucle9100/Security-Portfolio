Training Findings
1. Public S3 Bucket (Test Scenario)
Test Resources:

s3://testclient-transaction-logs (Demo bucket)

Config Rule: s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited

Learning Objective:

Demonstrate public access remediation

PCI DSS 3.4 Implementation

Automation:

python
# Training Lambda Script
def training_remediation(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.put_public_access_block(
        Bucket=event['detail']['resourceId'],
        PublicAccessBlockConfiguration=TEST_POLICY
    )
2. EC2 IMDSv1 Exposure (Training Case)
Test Resources:

EC2: i-0TESTCLIENT12345 (Demo instance)

Config Rule: ec2-imdsv2-check

Learning Objective:

Enforce metadata security

CIS 4.1 Implementation

Remediation:

terraform
# Training Configuration
resource "aws_instance" "demo_server" {
  metadata_options {
    http_tokens   = "required" # IMDSv2
  }
}
Compliance Mapping Exercise
Standard	Requirement	Training Implementation
PCI DSS 3.4	Encryption	S3 Default Encryption
CIS 4.1	IMDSv2	EC2 Launch Template
NIST SI-4	Monitoring	Config + CloudWatch
Appendix
A. Test AWS Resources
Resource	ARN	Purpose
Lambda	arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789:function:testclient-remediator	Training automation
S3 Bucket	arn:aws:s3:::testclient-transaction-logs	Demo data store
B. Verification Exercise
bash
# Training environment check
aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule \
  --config-rule-name s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited \
  --compliance-types NON_COMPLIANT \
  --query "EvaluationResults"
Expected Training Output: []

Learning Outcomes:

AWS Config rule implementation
