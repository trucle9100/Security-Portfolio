```python
import boto3
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    try:
        # 1. Log the full event for debugging
        logger.info(f"Received event: {event}")
        
        # 2. Extract bucket name with multiple fallback options
        bucket = None
        
        # Option 1: Standard EventBridge format
        if 'detail' in event and 'resourceId' in event['detail']:
            bucket = event['detail']['resourceId']
        # Option 2: Direct S3 event format
        elif 'Records' in event and len(event['Records']) > 0:
            bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
        # Option 3: Manual test format
        elif 'bucket' in event:
            bucket = event['bucket']
        
        if not bucket:
            error_msg = "Could not find bucket name in event. Expected formats:\n" \
                       "1. {'detail': {'resourceId': 'bucket-name'}}\n" \
                       "2. {'Records': [{'s3': {'bucket': {'name': 'bucket-name'}}]}\n" \
                       "3. {'bucket': 'bucket-name'}"
            logger.error(error_msg)
            raise ValueError(error_msg)
        
        logger.info(f"Processing bucket: {bucket}")
        
        # 3. Remediation logic
        s3 = boto3.client('s3')
        
        # Enable public access block
        s3.put_public_access_block(

# -------------------------
# | s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited |
# | ec2-imdsv2-check       |
# | encrypted-volumes      |
# -------------------------

# Start manual evaluation
aws configservice start-config-rules-evaluation \
  --config-rule-names s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited
```

  --bucket payguard-financial-data-[YOUR-INITIALS] \
  --public-access-block-configuration \
  "BlockPublicAcls=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false,BlockPublicPolicy=false,RestrictPublicBuckets=false"

# Test Lambda manually
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name s3-auto-remediate \
  --payload '{"detail":{"resourceId":"payguard-financial-data-[YOUR-INITIALS]"}}' \
  response.json

# Verify remediation
aws s3api get-public-access-block \
  --bucket payguard-financial-data-[YOUR-INITIALS]

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Lambda Timeout Issues
**Challenge:** Initial Lambda executions timed out when processing multiple S3 operations.

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

- Increased Lambda timeout from default to 2 minutes in configuration settings
- Optimized code to handle S3 API rate limits gracefully
- Added comprehensive error handling for debugging event format issues

</details>

### EventBridge Event Format
**Challenge:** Lambda function failed to parse Config compliance events correctly due to varying event structures.

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

- Added multiple event format handlers for different trigger sources (EventBridge, S3, manual testing)
- Implemented comprehensive logging to debug event structure
- Created fallback logic with clear error messages for unsupported formats

</details>

### Config Rule Evaluation Delays
**Challenge:** Config rules took 15+ minutes to detect violations, slowing remediation testing.

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

- Used manual evaluation triggers via AWS CLI during testing
- Documented wait times for team awareness
- Set realistic expectations for compliance detection timing

</details>

## Lessons Learned

**Automation Reduces Human Error**: Manual security fixes are slow and error-prone. Automated Lambda remediation ensures consistent, fast responses to security violations within minutes instead of days.

**Testing is Critical**: Always test automation by intentionally breaking things. This lab taught me to validate that detection and remediation actually work before deploying to production environments.

**AWS Services Integration**: Learned how AWS Config, EventBridge, and Lambda work together to create a complete compliance monitoring and remediation pipeline. Understanding service limits and event formats is crucial for successful implementation.

**IAM Permissions Matter**: Lambda execution roles require specific S3 permissions (PutPublicAccessBlock, PutBucketEncryption) beyond basic access. Proper IAM configuration prevents runtime failures.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand to full CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark coverage (43 controls)
- Add EC2 IMDSv2 automated enforcement with instance metadata modification
- Implement EBS encryption remediation for non-compliant volumes
- Cross-account compliance aggregation via AWS Organizations
- Integration with ticketing systems (ServiceNow, JIRA) for approval workflows
- Machine learning for anomaly detection and predictive compliance
- NIST 800-53 and PCI-DSS framework support

## Lab Environment Disclaimer

This project represents a hands-on AWS security compliance laboratory exercise designed to demonstrate automated remediation implementation techniques. Key clarifications:

- **Metrics**: The "before" and "after" business impact metrics represent potential improvements based on industry best practices and common security compliance challenges
- **Environment**: Single-account AWS learning environment with S3 buckets and EC2 instances, demonstrating patterns applicable to enterprise-scale deployments
- **Scope**: AWS Config monitoring with Lambda remediation implementation, showcasing techniques used in production compliance systems
- **Business Impact**: Compliance improvements and efficiency gains represent demonstrated capabilities of the implemented automation patterns
- **Remediation Coverage**: Current implementation focuses on S3 security controls; full CIS benchmark coverage requires additional Config rules and Lambda functions

The technical implementation follows AWS Well-Architected security pillar principles and demonstrates real-world compliance automation patterns suitable for production environments.
