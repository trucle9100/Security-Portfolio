## Executive Summary  
This simulated engagement demonstrates PCI DSS compliance automation techniques using test AWS resources in a sandbox environment.

### Key Training Outcomes  
| Metric | Pre-Simulation | Post-Simulation |  
|--------|----------------|-----------------|  
| Compliance Score | 58% | 94% |  
| Critical Risks | 3 | 0 |  
| MTTR | 72h | 8m |

    title Simulated Risk Distribution
    "Public Data Exposure": 45
    "Credential Compromise": 35
    "Logging Gaps": 20
```

## Simulated Findings
1. Public S3 Bucket (Critical)
    - Test Resources: (`s3://testclient-transaction-logs`) (Training bucket)
    - Config Rule: (`s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited`)
    - Learning Objective: Demonstrate public access remediation
    - Mapped Control: PCI DSS 3.4
    - Solution: Training Lambda Script (Python)
        ```python
        def lambda_handler(event, context):
            bucket = event['detail']['resourceId']
            if 'testclient' in bucket:  # Safety check
                s3 = boto3.client('s3')
                s3.put_public_access_block(
                    Bucket=bucket,
                    PublicAccessBlockConfiguration=SAFE_POLICY
                )
        ```
        
2. Delayed Incident Response
    - Training Setup:
       * CloudWatch Alarm: (`training-compliance-breach`)
       * SNS Topic: (`arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789:testclient-alerts`)
    - Learning Objective: Build real-time monitoring
    - Solution (Bash): Training Alert Configuration
        ```bash
        aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
          --alarm-name "training-compliance-breach" \
          --namespace "AWS/Config" \
          --metric-name "NonCompliantResources" \
          --threshold 1 \
          --evaluation-periods 1
        ```

## Compliance Mapping Exercise
| Standard              | Requirement            | Simulation Focus        |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **PCI DSS 3.4**       | Encryption-at-rest     | S3/KMS implementation   |
| **CIS 4.1**           | IMDSv2 enforcement     | EC2 metadata hardening  |
| **NIST SI-4**         | Continuous monitoring  | Config+CloudWatch setup |
---

## Next Learning Steps:
- Add RDS encryption simulation
- Practice cross-account Security Hub
- Explore Service Control Policies (SCPs)
