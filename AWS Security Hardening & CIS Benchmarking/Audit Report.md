## Core Architecture Implemented

### 1. CIS Benchmark Compliance Stack
```
AWS Config (Detection) → EventBridge (Orchestration) → Lambda (Remediation)
    ↓
CloudWatch Dashboard (Monitoring) → Security Hub (Centralized View)
```

### 2. Critical Security Controls Deployed
**S3 Hardening:**
- Public access blocking automation
- Default encryption enforcement (AES-256)
- Bucket policy compliance validation

**EC2 Security:**

## Implementation Walkthrough

### Step 1: Deploy Non-Compliant Resources (Testing Foundation)
```bash
# Create vulnerable S3 bucket for testing
aws s3 mb s3://payguard-financial-data-initials
aws s3api put-public-access-block --bucket payguard-financial-data-initials --public-access-block-configuration "BlockPublicAcls=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false,BlockPublicPolicy=false,RestrictPublicBuckets=false"

# Launch EC2 with IMDSv1 vulnerability
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345 --instance-type t3.micro --metadata-options "HttpTokens=optional"
```

### Step 2: Configure AWS Config for CIS Monitoring
```bash
# Enable Config with CIS-compliant rules
aws configservice start-configuration-recorder
aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule '{
  "ConfigRuleName": "s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited",
  "Source": {"Owner": "AWS", "SourceIdentifier": "S3_BUCKET_PUBLIC_WRITE_PROHIBITED"}
}'
```

### Step 3: Deploy Auto-Remediation Lambda
**Core Remediation Logic:**
```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    bucket = event['detail']['resourceId']
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    
    # Enable public access block
    s3.put_public_access_block(
        Bucket=bucket,
        PublicAccessBlockConfiguration={
            'BlockPublicAcls': True,
            'IgnorePublicAcls': True,
            'BlockPublicPolicy': True,
            'RestrictPublicBuckets': True
        }
    )
    
    # Enable default encryption
    s3.put_bucket_encryption(
        Bucket=bucket,
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration={
            'Rules': [{'ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault': {'SSEAlgorithm': 'AES256'}}]
        }
    )
```

### Step 4: EventBridge Automation Trigger
```json
{
  "source": ["aws.config"],
  "detail-type": ["Config Rules Compliance Change"],
  "detail": {
    "messageType": ["ComplianceChangeNotification"],
    "newEvaluationResult": {
      "complianceType": ["NON_COMPLIANT"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Compliance Validation Testing
```bash
# Force non-compliance to test automation
aws s3api put-public-access-block \
  --bucket payguard-financial-data-initials \
  --public-access-block-configuration \
  "BlockPublicAcls=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false"

# Verify auto-remediation (within 5-10 minutes<sup>[9](#ref9)</sup>)
aws s3api get-public-access-block \
  --bucket payguard-financial-data-initials
# Expected: All settings automatically restored to "true"
```

## CIS Benchmark Controls Implemented

| **CIS Control** | **Requirement** | **Implementation** | **Status** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **2.1.1** | S3 Bucket Encryption | Lambda auto-enables AES-256 | Automated |
| **2.1.5** | Block Public Access | EventBridge → Lambda remediation | Automated |
| **5.2.1** | IMDSv2 Enforcement | Config rule monitoring | Monitored |
| **3.1** | CloudTrail Logging | Centralized audit trail | Enabled |

## Technical Architecture Benefits

### 1. Self-Healing Security Infrastructure
- **Problem**: Manual remediation leads to prolonged exposure
- **Solution**: EventBridge triggers Lambda within 8 minutes of violation
- **Impact**: 99% reduction<sup>[7](#ref7)</sup> in security exposure window from 72 hours to 8 minutes

### 2. Continuous Compliance Monitoring
- **Problem**: Point-in-time compliance assessments miss drift
- **Solution**: AWS Config provides real-time compliance state
- **Impact**: 100% visibility<sup>[8](#ref8)</sup> into security posture changes

### 3. Scalable Automation Framework
- **Problem**: Manual processes don't scale with cloud growth
- **Solution**: Policy-as-code approach with Lambda remediation
- **Impact**: Consistent security controls across all resources

---

## Compliance & Audit Readiness

### SOC2 Type II Evidence Generated
- **Automated Controls**: Lambda execution logs prove remediation
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Config compliance history for auditors
- **Access Controls**: IAM policies restricting security modifications
- **Audit Trail**: CloudTrail logs for all security-related actions

### Audit Artifacts Created
```bash
# Generate compliance report
aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule --config-rule-name s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited

# Export remediation logs
aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/s3-auto-remediate --start-time 1640995200000
```

## Key Technical Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Event-Driven Security Architecture
**Pattern**: Config Rule Violation → EventBridge → Lambda → Remediation
**Value**: Eliminates human delay in security response

### 2. Infrastructure as Code Security
**Pattern**: Policy definitions stored in version control
**Value**: Reproducible, auditable security configurations

### 3. Shift-Left Security Approach
**Pattern**: Prevention through automation vs. detection after breach
**Value**: Proactive security posture vs. reactive incident response

## Production Scaling Considerations

**For Enterprise Implementation:**
- **Multi-Account**: Extend Config rules across AWS Organization
- **Advanced Remediation**: EC2 IMDSv2 enforcement, RDS encryption
- **Integration**: SIEM integration for security operations center
- **Compliance**: Extend to PCI-DSS, HIPAA, FedRAMP requirements
