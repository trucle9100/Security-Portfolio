## Core Architecture Implemented

### Architecture Overview
![Architecture Diagram](diagram/ServerlessApplication.png)

**Core Components:**
- **Amazon S3**: Static website hosting with public access configuration
- **API Gateway**: REST endpoint with CORS and security controls
- **Step Functions**: Workflow orchestration with error handling and retries
- **AWS Lambda**: Email processing with SES permissions
- **Amazon SES**: Verified email delivery service

### Serverless Email Processing Pipeline
```
S3 Static Site → API Gateway → Step Functions → Lambda → SES
                      ↓                ↓           ↓
                 CloudWatch ← Error Handling → Email Delivery
```

## Implementation Walkthrough

### Step 1: Lambda Function with Error Handling
Implemented serverless compute function with comprehensive error handling:

```python
import boto3
import json

ses = boto3.client('ses')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    try:
        # Validate input
        required_fields = ['email', 'subject', 'message']
        if not all(field in event for field in required_fields):
            raise ValueError("Missing required fields")
            
        response = ses.send_email(
            Source='verified-email@example.com',  # Replace with your SES email
            Destination={'ToAddresses': [event['email']]},
            Message={
                'Subject': {'Data': event['subject']},
                'Body': {'Text': {'Data': event['message']}}
            }
        )
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps({'message': 'Email sent successfully', 'response': response})
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': json.dumps({'error': str(e)})
        }
```

### Step 2: Step Functions State Machine with Retries
Created fault-tolerant workflow with exponential backoff:

```json
{
  "StartAt": "SendEmail",
  "States": {
    "SendEmail": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:SendEmailLambda",
      "Retry": [
        {
          "ErrorEquals": ["Lambda.ServiceException", "Lambda.Unknown"],
          "IntervalSeconds": 2,
          "MaxAttempts": 3,
          "BackoffRate": 2
        }
      ],
      "Catch": [
        {
          "ErrorEquals": ["States.ALL"],
          "Next": "NotifyFailure"
        }
      ],
      "Next": "SuccessState"
    },
    "NotifyFailure": {
      "Type": "Fail",
      "Error": "EmailFailed",
      "Cause": "Failed to send email after retries"
    },
    "SuccessState": {
      "Type": "Succeed"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Least-Privilege IAM Policy
Configured minimal permissions following security best practices:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ses:SendEmail", "ses:SendRawEmail"],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["logs:CreateLogGroup", "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Secure CORS Configuration
Implemented single-origin access control:

```xml
<CORSConfiguration>
  <CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>https://your-website-bucket.s3-website.REGION.amazonaws.com</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
  </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

## Security Controls Implementation

| **Security Control** | **Implementation** | **Benefit** |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Input Validation** | Server-side validation of all form fields | Prevents injection attacks |
| **CORS Policy** | Single-origin restrictions | Mitigates cross-site attacks |
| **IAM Least Privilege** | Custom roles with minimal permissions | Reduces attack surface |
| **API Security** | Optional API key authentication | Controls access |
| **HTTPS/TLS** | Enforced on all endpoints | Encrypts data in transit |
